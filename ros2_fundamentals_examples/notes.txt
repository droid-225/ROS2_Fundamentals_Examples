Video 1: ROS2 Package Setup
CD into topmost SRC directory in your ROS 2 workspace, then type the following command to create a ROS2 package:

  ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --license Apache-2.0 <package name>

* ament_cmake: Makes a C++ ROS2 package
* Apache-2.0: Distribution license, it basically makes this code open source 
* <package name>: Put name of package here

Then, to build the project:

  colcon build  

Then, to check if the build worked:

  ros2 pkg list
  
* Search for the package you made

Kinda extra but super helpful: To more easily build projects in the ROS 2 workspace,

  echo "alias build='cd ~/<workspace name> && colcon build'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
  
* <workspace name>: Replace with name of your ROS 2 workspace's name
* I guess this only works for Linux distros that use bashrc, I'm just using Ubuntu so idk
* Now you can just type "build" to build the projects

To only build a specific package instead of all the packages in the workspace:

  colcon build --packages-select <package name>
  
* <package name>: Replace with name of specific package you want to build

There's a lot of updating, upgrading, and downloading after this, just watch the video.


Video 2: How To Create a ROS2 Python Publisher
Name of folder housing publisher (and maybe other code) needs to be the same as the root package name.
In this case the folder is named ros2_fundamental_examples for that reason.

Syntax for README.md file:
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax


Update the package.xml file to include the following:

 <buildtool_depend>ament_cmake_python</buildtool_depend>

  <depend>rclcpp</depend>
  <depend>rcply</depend>
  <depend>std_msgs</depend>

Also, update the <description> and <maintainer> tag values as necessary.

CMakeLists.txt file defines how a ROS 2 package should be built. 
It is used by the ROS 2 system for building the code into executables.
XML file basically is to let the the build know which packages are needed.
The dependencies should be placed in both files for these reasons.

Check the CMakeLists.txt updates in the video, some very important but long and tedious stuff.

To check which topics are currently running, run:
  ros2 topic list

To check the contents of a particular running topic:
  ros2 topic <topic name>

To check frequncy in hz (per second) of a running topic:
  ros2 topic hz <topic name>

To get more info about a running topic:
  ros2 topic info <topic name>
* Add "--verbose" at the end after <topic name> to get more details.

To get more info on ROS 2 topic functions: 
https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics.html

To list currently active nodes:
  ros2 node list

To get info about an active node:
  ros2 node info <node name>

To check how all the nodes are communicating:
  rqt_graph
* Click the refresh button on upper left of graph window if nodes don't show up.


Video 3: How to Create a ROS 2 Python Subscriber
Make and program the py_minimal_subscriber node in the ros2_fundamental_examples subfolder.
Add the py_minimal_subscriber to the Python script install list in the CMakeLists.txt file.

In real production environments, we would usually create a bash script to run the publisher and
subscriber nodes in order.

To do this, first make or ensure you have a 'scripts' folder in the upper level ros2_fundamental_examples folder.

Create the minimal_pub_sub_launch.sh bash script in the scritps folder and follow the video instructions.

CD into the scripts folder after finishing writing the bash script.
To make the script an executable:
  sudo chmod +x <script name>

To check the permission of the newly made executable:
  ls -la

Add the scripts folder to the CMakeLists.txt file where the necessary folders to be installed are written.


Video 4: How to Create a ROS 2 C++ Publisher
Make a new "cpp_minimal_publisher.cpp" file in the src folder of the ros2_fundamental_examples folder.

Write the code for the cpp_minimal_publisher file and change the necessary parameters in the CMakeLists.txt file.

Don't worry about the error sqwiggles on the #inlcudes in the cpp_minimal_publisher, they don't actually affect
anything.
